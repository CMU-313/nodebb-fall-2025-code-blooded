# Install and Configure Stryker Mutation Testing Framework

## Summary

This PR installs and configures Stryker, a mutation testing framework for JavaScript, to enhance the quality assurance process for NodeBB. Stryker helps identify gaps in test coverage by introducing small changes (mutations) to the code and verifying that our tests catch these changes.

## Installation Evidence

### Package Installation
Added the following packages to `devDependencies` in `package.json`:

```json
"@stryker-mutator/core": "^9.2.0",
"@stryker-mutator/mocha-runner": "^9.2.0"
```

**File Changes:**
- `package.json` - Added Stryker packages to devDependencies
- `package.json` - Added `"stryker": "stryker run"` script to npm scripts

### Configuration File
Created `stryker.config.mjs` with comprehensive configuration:

```javascript
// @ts-check
/** @type {import('@stryker-mutator/api/core').PartialStrykerOptions} */
const config = {

```

## Configuration Details

### Test Runner Selection
- **Initial Approach**: Attempted to use `mocha` test runner directly
- **Final Approach**: Configured to use `command` test runner with npm test command
- **Rationale**: NodeBB's complex test setup requires the full npm test environment

### File Selection Strategy
- **Target Files**: `src/**/*.js` (excluding system files)
- **Excluded Files**: 
  - System files (`loader.js`, `app.js`, `emailer.js`)
  - Upgrade scripts (`src/upgrades/**/*.js`)
  - Test files (`test/**/*.js`) - handled by npm test command
  - Build artifacts and dependencies

### Timeout Configuration
- **Timeout**: 120 seconds (2 minutes)
- **Rationale**: NodeBB tests can be slow due to database setup and complex initialization

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Run Stryker with default configuration
npm run stryker

# Run on specific files
npm run stryker -- --mutate "src/controllers/composer.js"

# Dry run to test configuration
npm run stryker -- --dryRunOnly

# Run with custom timeout
npm run stryker -- --timeoutMS 180000
```

### Advanced Usage
```bash
# Run on multiple files
npm run stryker -- --mutate "src/controllers/composer.js,src/posts/create.js"

# Run with specific test pattern
npm run stryker -- --mutate "src/controllers/composer.js" --command.args "test -- --grep 'Anonymous Posting'"

# Run with incremental mode for faster subsequent runs
npm run stryker -- --incremental
```

## Benefits

### Quality Assurance
- **Mutation Testing**: Identifies gaps in test coverage by introducing small code changes
- **Test Quality**: Ensures tests actually catch bugs, not just pass
- **Code Coverage**: Complements traditional coverage metrics with behavioral testing

### Development Workflow
- **CI Integration**: Can be integrated into continuous integration pipelines
- **Incremental Testing**: Supports incremental mode for faster development cycles
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easily adaptable to different parts of the codebase

### NodeBB Integration
- **Framework Compatibility**: Works with NodeBB's existing Mocha test setup
- **Database Testing**: Compatible with NodeBB's database-dependent tests
- **Plugin Testing**: Can be used to test NodeBB plugins and extensions

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Coverage Analysis**: Enable coverage analysis for more detailed mutation reports
- **Dashboard Integration**: Connect to Stryker dashboard for historical tracking
- **Custom Mutators**: Add custom mutators for NodeBB-specific patterns
- **Performance Optimization**: Fine-tune timeout and concurrency settings

### Integration Opportunities
- **GitHub Actions**: Add Stryker to CI/CD pipeline
- **Code Review**: Include mutation score in pull request checks
- **Monitoring**: Set up alerts for mutation score degradation

## Conclusion

Stryker has been successfully installed and configured for NodeBB. The mutation testing framework is now ready to enhance our quality assurance process by identifying gaps in test coverage and ensuring our tests effectively catch bugs.

The configuration is optimized for NodeBB's complex test environment and provides a solid foundation for ongoing mutation testing efforts.
